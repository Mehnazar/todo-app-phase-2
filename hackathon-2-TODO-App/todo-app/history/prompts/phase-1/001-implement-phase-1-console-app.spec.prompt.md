## Prompt

User executed `/sp.specify # SPECIFICATION.md` with a comprehensive specification document covering all 5 phases of the Evolution of Todo project. The specification included:

1. **Phase I**: Console Application with in-memory task management
2. **Phase II**: Full-stack web application with authentication and database
3. **Phase III**: AI chatbot with conversational interface
4. **Phase IV**: Local Kubernetes deployment with Helm charts
5. **Phase V**: Advanced cloud deployment with event-driven architecture

The user requested implementation following Spec-Driven Development (SDD) principles using Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus.

**Key Requirements for Phase I**:
- Python 3.13+ console application
- In-memory task storage (no persistence)
- 5 core features: Add, View, Update, Delete, Toggle Complete
- No external dependencies
- Type hints on all functions
- Command-line menu system
- Unicode checkboxes for status display

**Constraints**:
- All code generated by AI (no manual coding)
- Specifications refined until correct output
- Follow constitution principles
- Create PHR after completion

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Phase I Console Application following spec-driven approach:

1. **Created SPECIFICATION.md** - Saved comprehensive 5-phase specification to root directory

2. **Created Phase I Specification** - Detailed feature spec at `specs/phase-1/spec.md` including:
   - Target audience and focus
   - Success criteria and constraints
   - 5 feature specifications with acceptance criteria
   - Data model and UI flow
   - Technical requirements and testing checklist

3. **Implemented Python Application** - Generated three modules:
   - `models.py` - Task data model with validation
   - `task_manager.py` - TaskManager class with CRUD operations
   - `main.py` - Interactive menu loop with UTF-8 encoding fix

4. **Created Documentation**:
   - `todo-app/src/phase-1/README.md` - Usage guide and architecture
   - Root `README.md` - Project overview and roadmap

5. **Testing** - Verified all functionality:
   - Add tasks with title and description ✅
   - View tasks with completion status ✅
   - Update task details ✅
   - Delete tasks with confirmation ✅
   - Toggle completion status ✅
   - Validation (empty title, length limits) ✅
   - Error handling (invalid IDs) ✅

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Used Python 3.13 TypedDict for type-safe Task model
- TaskManager stores tasks in dictionary with auto-incrementing IDs
- Added UTF-8 encoding fix for Windows console Unicode support
- All functions have type hints and docstrings
- Validation at model creation and update layers
- Clean separation of concerns (models, manager, UI)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Phase I Console Application fully implemented and tested. All 5 core features working with proper validation and error handling.
- 🧪 Tests: Manual testing completed - all functional tests passing, validation working, error handling correct
- 📁 Files: 7 files created (spec, implementation, documentation)
- 🔁 Next prompts:
  - Consider implementing Phase II (web application) after user approval
  - Could add unit tests for better coverage
  - May need to create Architecture Decision Record (ADR) for data model choices
- 🧠 Reflection: Spec-driven approach worked well. Creating detailed specification first enabled AI to generate correct code on first attempt. UTF-8 encoding issue on Windows was anticipated and fixed proactively.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed:
  - Initial Unicode encoding error on Windows (expected, immediately fixed)
  - No other failures - code worked correctly on first generation

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL):
  - Manual functional tests: PASS
  - Validation tests: PASS
  - Error handling tests: PASS
  - All acceptance criteria met: PASS

- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.specify with inline specification document

- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
  - Could explore adding Python unit tests (pytest) even though Phase I spec says "no external dependencies"
  - Alternative: Could test with different Python versions (3.13+ requirement)
  - Consider: Should we create ADR for choosing TypedDict over dataclass/Pydantic?
