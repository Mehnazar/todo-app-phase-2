# Phase I: Console Todo Application

A simple, in-memory task management application built with Python 3.13+ following Spec-Driven Development principles.

## Features

✅ **Add Task** - Create tasks with title and optional description
✅ **View Tasks** - Display all tasks with completion status
✅ **Update Task** - Modify task title and/or description
✅ **Delete Task** - Remove tasks with confirmation
✅ **Toggle Complete** - Mark tasks as complete or incomplete

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher
- No external dependencies (uses Python standard library only)

## Installation

No installation required! The application uses only Python's standard library.

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
cd src/phase-1
python main.py
```

### Menu Options

```
=== Todo List Manager ===
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Update Task
4. Delete Task
5. Toggle Complete
6. Exit
```

### Example Session

```
> Add Task
Enter title: Buy groceries
Enter description (optional): Milk, eggs, bread
✓ Task #1 created: "Buy groceries"

> View Tasks
Your Tasks:
[1] ☐ Buy groceries

> Toggle Complete
Enter task ID: 1
✓ Task #1 marked as complete

> View Tasks
Your Tasks:
[1] ✓ Buy groceries
```

## Architecture

### File Structure

```
src/phase-1/
├── main.py          # Entry point with menu loop
├── task_manager.py  # Task CRUD operations
├── models.py        # Task data model
└── README.md        # This file
```

### Data Model

```python
Task {
    id: int           # Auto-incrementing unique identifier
    title: str        # 1-200 characters, required
    description: str  # 0-1000 characters, optional
    completed: bool   # Default: False
}
```

### Storage

- **In-memory only** - Tasks stored in a Python dictionary
- **No persistence** - All data lost when application exits
- **Single-user** - No authentication or user management

## Validation Rules

- **Title**: Required, 1-200 characters
- **Description**: Optional, max 1000 characters
- **Task ID**: Must exist in the task list
- **Confirmation**: Required for deletion (y/yes)

## Error Handling

| Error | Message |
|-------|---------|
| Empty title | "Title cannot be empty." |
| Title too long | "Title must be 200 characters or less." |
| Description too long | "Description must be 1000 characters or less." |
| Invalid task ID | "Task #X not found." |
| Invalid menu choice | "Invalid option. Please choose 1-6." |

## Development Principles

This code was generated following **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** principles:

1. **Specification First** - All features defined in `specs/phase-1/spec.md`
2. **AI-Generated Code** - Implemented by Claude Code (no manual coding)
3. **Type Safety** - Full type hints for Python 3.13+
4. **Clean Architecture** - Separation of concerns (models, manager, UI)
5. **Documentation** - Docstrings on all functions explaining WHY

## Testing

### Manual Test Cases

Run through these scenarios to verify functionality:

- [ ] Add task with title only
- [ ] Add task with title and description
- [ ] Add task with title > 200 chars (should fail)
- [ ] Add task with description > 1000 chars (should fail)
- [ ] View empty task list
- [ ] View task list with multiple tasks
- [ ] Update task title only
- [ ] Update task description only
- [ ] Update both title and description
- [ ] Update non-existent task (should fail)
- [ ] Delete task with confirmation (y)
- [ ] Delete task without confirmation (n)
- [ ] Delete non-existent task (should fail)
- [ ] Toggle task to complete
- [ ] Toggle task to incomplete
- [ ] Toggle non-existent task (should fail)
- [ ] Exit application

## Limitations (By Design)

These are intentional constraints for Phase I:

- No persistent storage (in-memory only)
- No user authentication
- No priority levels or tags
- No due dates or reminders
- No search or filter functionality
- No multi-user support

See [SPECIFICATION.md](../../../SPECIFICATION.md) for future phases that address these limitations.
